In addition to updating the operatic form, the movie embraces its epic destiny. Instead of playing to the short attention spans of those who love the bloated excesses of Batman, or the adolescent charm of the Avengers, Les Miserables has the courage to examine just how hard it is to change anything for the better, and the redemption available for those willing to try. I have seldom been so moved by a motion picture and never by a musical. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and the luminous Samantha Barks shine.

The low critic reviews are a little suprising, but not so much when we consider Kaufman's tragically low rating of 67 for Synechdoche New York. Sometimes they get it wrong. Firstly, Heidecker's turn as the lead in a serious film was criminally passed over. Naturalistic, realistic acting appears to be becoming a thing of the past in mainstream film, so his portrayal in this is refreshing. The movie is not a comedy, but it is very funny in parts, thanks mainly to Tim's cruel deadpan and his chemistry with Eric Wareheim. It's a character study, and one that finally targets the apathy and emotional distance of aging 30 year olds who aren't willing or able to let go of their youth or play the 'game.'

The film is lean, coming in just over two hours. It just drips with tension and drama, and it doesn't shy away from the brutal violence of the period.  In a way, I was reminded of the dread I felt watching Mississippi Burning for the first time.

It's a movie about a Melbourne family known for taking down banks, but it's more specifically about a young family member's learning to survive in the animal kingdom. The acting is uniformly superb. The writing does away with all of the hackneyed scenes we've seen a thousand times before.  There's no need for the courtroom scene, or that of the young grieving widow, or funerals.

Anne Dorval as the thick skinned but tackily dressed mother of a violent and uncontrollable son, is a gutsy and loud presence that can’t be ignored. Suzanne Clement, on the other hand, subtly shows us the layers of a withdrawn wife and mother who’s stuttering only begins to subside when around these two larger than life individuals.

Director Scott Hooper hones in on his fine cast, which is in fact one of the best ensembles in recent memory, and hypnotically draws us in to their hum drum and rather melancholic lives. Pennsylvania looks every bit as bleak as I remember it from 'The Deer Hunter' and this is perfectly captured in the stark cinematography. The camera's eye treats the steel mill and surrounding areas as if they are another character and you really do get a sense of the place and the unfulfilled lives of the people living there. At times the film's tone is extremely tense, a lot of which is due to the menacing performance of Woody Harrelson who looks as if he has just stepped out of 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Christian Bale, in a rare understated but none the less brilliant turn, is even better here than he is n his Oscar nominated role in 'American Hustle'. Casey Affleck and Willem Defoe also impress and one has to applaud Sam Shepard, who seems to have an uncanny knack for being only minimally involved in really good films. The music is surprisingly beautiful given the content, which is at times extremely violent, and the film holds you in a vice like grip from beginning to end.

The design and costumes are truly beautiful, and last but by no means least the writing where most films of this ilk fall down badly. Not here, however. The story is propelled onwards and upwards by intelligent dialogue delivered with expert precision by the entire cast. At the moment it seems to me that the Danes have cornered the market in quality entertainment, not only in film, but also on tv where their output is also of an extremely high standard of late (Borgen; The Killing; The Bridge to name a few). See A Royal Affair at all costs as it is a gem of a film that has almost slipped by un noticed due to its minuscule release. If you like well acted and beautifully written period dramas about royalty you won't be disappointed."" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;2.5;6

Tom Cullen is so devastatingly good that I thought I knew him. The two characters are presented so honestly with all their flaws and insecurities that you are by turn fascinated and hypnotised by the simplicity of the excellent screenplay. When all is said and done at its heart this is a life affirming  love story which is not to be missed."" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;2.5;6
bridegroom;10;foxgrove;/user/foxgrove;Mar 30, 2014;"[ ""This amazing documentary is at once both life affirming and heart breaking. It tells the story of Tom and Shane who genuinely come across as 'the perfect couple' only to have their idyll shattered by a tragic accident. The film traces the now all too familiar story that they, as gay men growing up, suffered at the hands of small town mentalities. Testimonies lovingly articulated by family and friends bear out that their six year relationship really was one that most people would aspire to. Events following the accident appallingly demonstrate how cruel and selfish the actions can be by the people who purport  to love us the most, our parents!"", """", ""The film is a tear jerker of the first order and so the overly saccharine incidental music that creeps in from time to time isn't necessary as all the emotions are right up there on the screen. That said, however, there are some beautiful songs wonderfully integrated throughout which contribute to a film that will make your life all the richer for having seen it."" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;2.5;6
the-imitation-game;10;foxgrove;/user/foxgrove;Nov 28, 2014;"[ ""This true story of the breaking of the enigma code, which effectively ended World War 2, could so easily have turned out to be one of those overly clichéd and conventional bio-pics. However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has, surprisingly, become so much more. Starting with a smart and dense screenplay, which hones in on three different periods of time in the life of code breaker Alan Turing, the story is utterly compelling. Wisely, it has also been told in a straightforward and un complicated manner and after about 10 minutes one gets a dizzying sense that the film is going to be an absolute gem, a feeling that reaches fulfilment 2 hours later as the credits roll."", ""The recreation of time and place has been lovingly captured via excellent production design. In fact, the film is rich in detail. There are breathtaking vistas of war torn Britain which includes shots of bombers wreaking devastation over London and submarines firing rockets, as well as more ordinary depictions of rubble strewn streets and houses. It is also good to see the appropriate use of historic Bletchley Park as a backdrop to where all these events actually unfolded over 70 years ago. The editing seamlessly takes us from year to year without confusion or jarring transitions and the scenes leading up to, and immediately following, the breaking of the code are just thrilling. The music is another plus and whilst not particularly melodic it underscores what is happening on screen brilliantly."", ""Criticism has been levelled at the film for not focusing more on Turing’s sexuality which is as untrue as it is unfair. Beyond seeing him actually bonking we have more than enough information as to the effect his sexuality had on his life and, ultimately his death. Scenes of his childhood also give insight into the man he would become. End titles, unlike the recent ‘Foxcatcher’ are also helpful and informative."", ""Ultimately, the film belongs to its powerful cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation and he brings real humanity to the tortured Turing. Some of his moments, particularly near the end, are almost unbearably moving.  Keira Knightley is almost his equal in a smaller but crucial role. She has real power here as Turing’s one time fiancé, the lone woman breaker who as it turns out is better than the men. Supporting actors Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear and Mark Strong all contribute characters that are more than mere ciphers. Also, it is to the credit of the boy playing Turing as a young man that we believe in the subsequent actions and performance of Cumberbatch."", ""Rarely is a film as all encompassing and engrossing as this one. It is a triumph on every level and a cinematic treat."" ]";15.0;21.0;15.0;6.0;2.5;6
love-mercy;10;foxgrove;/user/foxgrove;Jul 16, 2015;"[ ""A refreshingly unfamiliar bio-pic which isn’t one of those conventional rags to riches stories so beloved of the genre, but which artistically are more often than not seen it all before pedestrian. This is a riveting, astoundingly well-acted drama concerning the mental illness afflicting The Beach Boys’ singer composer Brian Wilson, a story of which I knew absolutely nothing."", ""The original screenplay splits its running time between the younger Brian, struggling with group responsibilities as his grip on reality loosens, and the older one who is now a physical and emotional wreck in the care of people who really don’t care about him at all."", ""Director Bill Pohlad’s direction is lean and imaginative and through his actors unfolds a compelling story. As the girl who falls for and reaches out to Brian, Elizabeth Banks does some beautifully subtle and understated work conveying much without saying a word, particularly in her powerful scenes with Paul Giamatti as Brian’s unscrupulous therapist. Giamatti himself at first glance seems to be saddled with a clichéd cypher of a role, but the actor’s proven talent brings to the fore a true monster. Dano who is great at playing edgy or slightly off centre characters is in his element here as the younger Brian starting to lose control, but, amazingly, the real revelation is John Cusack as the older incarnation of the troubled singer/ composer. Cusack has often been an actor whose performances have tended to lack colour and shading, journeyman at best. Here, however, he is so much more. In a touching and compelling bit of acting he holds you spellbound whenever he is on screen."", ""The Beach Boys music permeates the film, but the story does not serve as its slave. Also, unusually, there are not any substantial concert scenes of which to speak. These are often perfunctorily thrown in when dealing with singers or groups and it is to the credit of the story that this gimmicky device was not deemed necessary in this particular instance. Period detail, most notably the costumes worn by Banks, is excellent and the sound is great. One of the best films of the year, thankfully, comes out in a summer when the season thus far has proved to be depressingly sillier than usual."" ]";4.0;5.0;4.0;1.0;2.5;6
la-la-land;10;foxgrove;/user/foxgrove;Dec 13, 2016;"[ ""La La Land is that rare movie that starts at the top and then goes on and up. At a time when musicals are not at all fashionable this one knocks it out of the park on all emotional and aesthetic levels. It is without question the best film of the year. An audacious opening song and dance number on an L A freeway sets the tone and here is where audiences will either embrace it or leave. Those who stay will be treated to one of those transcendent experiences that are all too rare in today's cinema. Who knew that Emma Stone could be this good demonstrating a range, and a voice, that takes one completely by surprise. Wonderfully supported by Ryan Gosling, the pair effortlessly create chemistry usually not seen outside a lab. Their renditions of a clutch of memorable songs are dynamically performed and stunningly choreographed. Stone's dulcet tones singing' Audition- The fools who dream' is heartbreakingly evocative and succeeds in raising the hairs on one's arms and neck. In fact the score and sound make the film seem like a throwback to an earlier age as does the gorgeous colour cinematography. Technically, every aspect of this unique entertainment has the wow factor. Emotionally the film is very well grounded with its biggest flight of fancy taking place at the Griffith observatory. Director Damien Chazelle trumps his achievement on 'Whiplash' by triumphantly reviving a moribund genre. That he has produced such a dazzling and accomplished piece of cinema in the process is no small feat. If this doesn't win best picture and actress at next year's Oscars (it will of course be loaded with them) then the Academy members themselves must be living in La La Land."" ]";7.0;13.0;7.0;6.0;2.5;6

This is a powerful and surprising story that is acted to perfection by Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman. Music and cinematography are great enhancers of the overall impact. On the face of it this felt like it would be just another routine drama, when in actuality it is the most surprising find of the year in cinema. A stunning must see."" ]";2.0;3.0;2.0;1.0;2.5;6

Pattinson is fantastic, but the movie would be nothing without the bravura performance by Buddy Duress who plays ex-Con Ray and who brings HUGE laughs. (Can't mention what role he plays in the film without giving away a major spoiler.)  I would be shocked if this film doesn't catapult him to much bigger and better things. Jennifer Jason Leigh, of course, is brilliant in a smaller role. I knew absolutely nothing about this film before seeing it, and I was really happy that I didn't - it's how I'd recommend you engage with it. Skip the trailer, don't read much up on it.
