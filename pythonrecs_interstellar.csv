flight;8;Edeltraud;/user/Edeltraud;Dec  2, 2012;"[ ""A flawed genius with a moral dilemma set against the backdrop of incredible heroics, intertwined with people who may or may not support him, and handsomely portrayed by Denzel. OK, the movie has it's flaws, too, but at least it was less predictable and had a few more surprises than most of the junk out there. The most unrealistic aspect was that the media didn't find Whip as he floundered around at funerals, bars and the crash site. BTW a movie's title doesn't have to be a tell-all. Besides, \""Flight\"" could certainly be metaphorical, too, in this story. I'd have liked a less tidy ending. He could've walked away to face his demons another way, leaving a more ambiguous moral resolution. But it was a good grown up movie without explosions and guns going off every two seconds. You could ask yourself what should he do, what will he do - what would I do? It was really enjoyable not to have a soundtrack that just thumped out what my emotional state was supposed to be all the time, there were several dramatic scenes with no background music at all. I'm not a fan of drugalcohol themes, but this was just a device here - at its core the story was about whether or not our good deeds can stand alone or are they diminished by our bad ones?"" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;inf;8
the-voices;8;Edeltraud;/user/Edeltraud;Oct 26, 2017;"[ ""Impossibly, this flick is a comedy, dark comedy, thriller, gore-fest/slasher, psychological thriller, absurdist, romance (and finally, a musical) that sorta, more or less, works. With that mixed genre, the viewer is whipped hither & yon, never quite sure what to expect or what to make of the goings on. The day after I saw it, I liked it even better & have to give it a pretty high score just for originality and the fact that it doesn't go off the rails (at least not in a bad way, you know, where the concept devolves into some annoying miasma of plot twists & artsy imagery.) Not only does The Voices cover all the aforementioned ground, but the film also provides insight into mental illness & childhood trauma in an entertaining way. Ryan Reynolds & Anna Kendrick wouldn't especially draw me to a movie, but they did a nice job here, especially Reynolds in his turn as a Dexter-esque dude. The topic of women getting stalked & slashed is something I'd typically avoid (hate that fetishy vibe & have seen it too much) -- but somehow this turn manages to embrace that theme in a OK way & give it a fresh take."" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;inf;8

More so than the LOTR series, and the main reason is - I like the casting much better in this series. Choice of actors is far better that the LOTR. Martin Freeman is excellent as Bilbo (as opposed to Frodo in LOTR who was awful), and Luke Evans should have been Aragorn in LOTR, however he's excellent as Bard. The others are just fine. I did not read the book - Hobbit (I tried, I just couldn't go on), and I think the movie is much better than the book, as opposed to LOTR where it's quite the opposite. Overall, fine trilogy."" ]";0.0;1.0;0.0;1.0;inf;8

Arnold in the original gives the whole movie a different quality and movie A was a sci fi whereas movie B, this one, is more future tech. They could have easily dropped some elements and called this movie memory war or something. Action was good but not overly believable and some aspects of the future like going through the centre of the earth and the rest of the world being uninhabitable were far fetched, if the rest of the world was poisoned I would like to have seen mutants. Anyway not great but I watched it with interest, so when a movie keeps your attention its pretty good."" ]";1.0;1.0;1.0;0.0;inf;8

The time travel twist allows the movie to be re-invented. I didn't like sarah connor, she was not as gutsy as linda Hamilton. I didn't like turning john connor the leader of the resistence into a skynet puppet idea, presumably now that his parents know the future they will keep him away from guns and enrol him in ballet classes. Who sent the terminator back to when sarah was a kid, I still don't know maybe next movie, how many time travel devices are there? The CGI for terminators coming through fire still looks like computer graphics to me. Skynet is not destroyed just delayed even though lots of buildings went down, doctor who has an ironic bit part, maybe in the future skynet is a time lord...or something. Now that I have seen this movie I would not buy it on dvd it seems to lack middle ground actors, its all about the main four stars."" ]";1.0;4.0;1.0;3.0;inf;8
